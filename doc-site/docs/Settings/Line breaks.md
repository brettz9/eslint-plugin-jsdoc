# Line breaks

## `maxLines` and `minLines`

One can use `minLines` and `maxLines` to indicate how many line breaks
(if any) will be checked to find a jsdoc comment block before the given
code block. These settings default to `0` and `1` respectively.

In conjunction with the `require-jsdoc` rule, these settings can
be enforced so as to report problems if a jsdoc block is not found within
the specified boundaries. The settings are also used in the fixer to determine
how many line breaks to add when a block is missing.

# `no-multi-asterisks`

## Introduction

Prevents use of multiple asterisks at the beginning of lines.

Note that if you wish to prevent multiple asterisks at the very beginning of
the jsdoc block, you should use `no-bad-blocks` (as that is not proper jsdoc
and that rule is for catching blocks which only seem like jsdoc).

## Options

### `allowWhitespace` (defaults to `false`)

Set to `true` if you wish to allow asterisks after a space (as with Markdown):

```js
/**
 * *bold* text
 */
```

### `preventAtMiddleLines` (defaults to `true`)

Prevent the likes of this:

```js
/**
 *
 **
 */
```

### `preventAtEnd` (defaults to `true`)

Prevent the likes of this:

```js
/**
 *
 *
 **/
```
